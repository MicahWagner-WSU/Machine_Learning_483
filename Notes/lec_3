QUIZ:
	- csv = pd.read_csv(csv_file)
		- csv.head()
	- arr = np.array(some_arr)
	- arr.shape()
	- ML came from AI

Datasets:
	- datasets are tubular in darascience
	- columns are features
		- categorial features are like enums (list of possible choices)
			- so weapons are lance, drill, etc.
			- weight is heavy build, light build
			- self righting is true or false
		- numerical features are more like numbers to describe data
			- weight in kilograms, stuff like that
	- rows are instances
	- when your target is a catergorical feature, you need to do classification
	- regressions tasks predict numeric features, classification tasks predict categorical features

Quiz:
	- a feature is a column of data
	- a target is technically a feature, its a label for the column of data
	- instance is a row of data
	- classification and regresion are both kinds of supervised learning because we have a target
	- classification deals with catergorical data regression deals with numerical data

Machine learning hypothesis:
	- machine learning is trying to find a correct hypothesis (see slides for example)
	- the hypothesis is a mathematic propositional statement
	- hypothesis space is all possible hypothesis for a dataset
	- hypothesis space size
		- take a table describing all possible outcomes, the last column represents the 
		hypothesis outcome. So however long the length of that column is, represent as a binary number, thats all possible outcomes, so 2^length of final column 
	- some hypothesis are bad, for instance, I always win
	- any reasonable algorithm must skip a couple hypothesis, we aren't going over all 2^2^n
	- ML algorithms apply an inference so that they dont check the whole hypothesis space
		- robots that beat meadium guys also probably beat light guys
		- so the algorithm has some bias
	- a database is a totally unbiased algorithm
		- to see if something wins, just look it up in a database
		- if its not there, just dont say anything

Favorite Project:
My favorite project was the project done by the Football team. This team's project was to classify plants based on an image. I liked this project because it used what we learned in class in kind of a surprising way, as we never directly talked about image recognition in class. I also liked this project because our family owns a blueberry farm, so I find any computer science application in the real world pretty interesting. I also thought this team presented well, as it was short, funny, and straight to the point. The speaker seemed confident and well-spoken.



M&N (our team):

Name: Noah Wagner

Contribution: Noah contributed to the team by programming most of the project, and training the model on his machine. He also downloaded all the training data which was very helpful considering the size of the data (several gigabytes). Noah also set up and ran the demo.

Contribution score: Contributed the same amount as me



Self Evaluation:

name: Mich Wagner

Contribution: I helped Noah code the project, and I created the presentation slides and conducted most of the presentation. I also came up with the method we used to clean up the dataset from Kaggle.

Contribution: I Contributed the same amount as Noah
